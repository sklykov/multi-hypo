# Stable Linkage at June 2018 version

Here are presented: 
- refreshed GUI with available up to the 20th of October features
- depreciated multi hypothesis making algorithm, however, which is the longer have been tested till October 2018. 

Maybe this version would make more reliable tracking results than the most up-to-date version. It strictly depends on the input type of data and needs to be tested as well. 
Possibly, the user may find this version more reliable for their goals, this is why I stored this version along the newest one.
