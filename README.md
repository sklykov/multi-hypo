# multi-hypo
The multi-hypothesis tracking program for fluorescently labelled partciles (vesicles, organelles etc) tracking

The project itself are written (designed) in the LabVIEW 2013 environment. I planned also in future to transfer it to new version of LabVIEW.
This project is developed with a purpose of more robust multiple objects (particles) tracking. Fluorescently labelled vesicles, organelles play the role of objects (particles) for tracking.

Because of previously following to the simplest version control, many of subprograms will be uploaded with enumeration (reflecting local version)
