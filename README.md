# multi-hypo
The multi-hypothesis tracking program for fluorescently labelled partciles (vesicles, organelles etc) tracking

The project itself has been written (designed) in the LabVIEW 2013 environment. 
Now, after recompilling, the project uses the LabVIEW 2017 environment (LV 2017 SP1)

This project is developed with a purpose of performing more robust multiple objects (particles) tracking. Fluorescently labelled vesicles (e.g. organelles) 
play the role of objects (particles) for tracking.

For whose, who would be interested in program development: 
Because of following during development stage to the simplest version control approach, many of subprograms have been uploaded with enumeration 
(reflecting their local version).
In general, it isn't so easy to find the way of proper version controlling approach for the graphical programming language ("G"). So, up to this moment,
I prefer to use some local numeration of versions.

The short explanation of hot to use program is described in the relevant * pdf file.
