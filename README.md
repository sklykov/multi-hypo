# multi-hypo
The multi-hypothesis tracking program for fluorescently labelled partciles (vesicles, organelles etc) tracking

The project itself is written (designed) in the LabVIEW 2013 environment. 
As the future plan, I will resave this project to more up-to-date version of LabVIEW. 

This project is developed with a purpose of performing more robust multiple objects (particles) tracking. Fluorescently labelled vesicles (e.g. organelles) play the role of objects (particles) 
for tracking.

Because of previously following to the simplest version control, many of subprograms will be uploaded with enumeration (reflecting their local version).
